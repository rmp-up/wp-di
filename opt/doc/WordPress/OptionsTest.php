/**
 * Options
 *
 * Options can be manipulated or loaded from other services using the options-provider:
 *
 * ```php
 * <?php
 *
 * use \RmpUp\WpDi\Provider\WordPress;
 *
 * return [
 *   WordPress\Options::class => [
 *     'my_fav_isni' => 423379498,
 *   ]
 * ];
 * ```
 *
 * Speaking of WordPress 4.7.0 (and above) this service will only be triggered
 * when the option is not set.
 * Once the option is set (e.g. in the database / via `set_option`)
 * the service won't be used.
 * This again saves some runtime for huge callbacks
 * or references as shown below.
