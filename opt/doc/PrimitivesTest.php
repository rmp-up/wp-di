/**
 * Global parameters
 *
 * By now a service had it's arguments directly injected:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * services:
 *   SomeThing:
 *     arguments: [ 1337, '2020-02-29' ]
 *   SomeThingElse:
 *     arguments: [ '2020-02-29', 42 ]
 * ```
 *
 * But here we seem to have some very central information (the "29.02")
 * which is reused.
 * To keep things maintainable this can go into it's own section
 * (e.g. "parameters"):
 *
 * ```yaml
 * parameters:
 *   leap_day: 2020-02-29
 *
 * services:
 *   SomeThing:
 *     arguments: [ 1337, '%leap_day%' ]
 *   SomeThingElse:
 *     arguments: [ '%leap_day%', 42 ]
 * ```
 *
 * In this part you'll learn about further siblings of "services"
 * like "parameters",
 * "options" (WordPress-Options),
 * "templates" (see `locate_template()`)
 * and other possibilities.
