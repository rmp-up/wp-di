/**
 * Introduction
 *
 *   Writing plugins can be a pain as everyone wants to do it different
 * and aim for different structures.
 * But what most of us have in common is that we want simplicity
 * and get away from WordPress to a more agnostic OOP workflow
 * to hold up testability, maintainability and all the other terms of software quality.
 *
 * We solve all of this by a simple service definition like this:
 *
 *
 * ```php
 * <?php // my-plugin-services.php
 *
 * use \RmpUp\WpDi\Provider;
 * use \RmpUp\WpDi\Provider\WordPress;
 *
 * return [
 *   Provider\Services::class => [
 *     AnRepository::class,
 *
 *     SomeSeoStuff::class => [
 *       'arguments' => [
 *         AnRepository::class,
 *         'some_foo'
 *       ]
 *     ]
 *   ],
 *
 *   WordPress\Options::class => [
 *     'some_foo' => 'The default value of this as long as not given',
 *   ]
 *
 *   WordPress\Actions::class => [
 *     'template_redirect' => [
 *       RejectUnauthorizedThings::class,
 *       SomeSeoStuff::class,
 *     ]
 *   ]
 * ];
 * ```
 *
 * Step after step this does:
 *
 * 1. Register the "AnRepository"-service
 * 2. Register the "SomeSeoStuff"-service
 *    * Use the "AnRepository"-service as first `__constructor` argument.
 *    * Use the "some_foo"-option as second argument.
 * 3. "Register" a "some_foo"-option with a default value.
 * 4. Add services to the `template_redirect` action:
 *    * A new "RejectUnauthorizedThings"-service
 *    * The existing "SomeSeoStuff"-service
 *
 * So in case the `template_redirect` action is fired the services
 * "RejectUnauthorizedThings" and "SomeSeoStuff" will be lazy loaded
 * and invoked (e.g. using `__invoke`).
 *
 *   This is the very short syntax.
 * Read on to know more about the complete syntax
 * and other possibilities like ...
 *
 *
 * * `WordPress\Filter` to register filter,
 * * `WordPress\PostTypes` to register post-types,
 * * `WordPress\CliCommands` to add services as command in wp-cli
 *
 * ... and more.
 *
 * We suggest separating the definition into it's own file(s)
 * and load it into the (Pimple-)Container afterwards:
 *
 * ```php
 * <?php
 *
 * $container = new \Pimple\Container();
 *
 * $container->register(
 *   new \RmpUp\WpDi\Provider( require 'my-plugin-services.php' )
 * );
 * ```
