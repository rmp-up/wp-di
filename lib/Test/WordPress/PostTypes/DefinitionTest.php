/**
 * Defining a post-type service
 *
 * Post-types can become services too which is very handy in some situations.
 * First you need to add the "post_type" keyword to register a new post-type:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * services:
 *   MyOwnPostType:
 *     post_type: animals
 * ```
 *
 * With this we have registered the post-type "animals".
 * An instance of the `MyOwnPostType` class will be converted into an array
 * which defines the post-type as known from `register_post_type()`.
