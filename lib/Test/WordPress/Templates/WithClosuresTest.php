/**
 * Custom resolver using callback
 *
 * When you need some custom implementation then it is still possible
 * to use anonymous functions:
 *
 * ```php
 * <?php
 *
 * use \RmpUp\WpDi\Provider\WordPress;
 *
 * return [
 *   WordPress\Templates::class => [
 *     'ncc-1717.php',
 *     'ncc-1701-a.php',
 *
 *     'my-footer.php' => static function ($container) {
 *       if ( 2286 < date( 'Y' ) ) {
 *         return $container['ncc-1717.php'];
 *       }
 *
 *       return $container['ncc-1701-a.php'];
 *     }
 *   ]
 * ];
 * ```
 *
 * Using a function enables you to switch templates at a specific time and date
 * or do other fancy stuff depending on the date-time,
 * the user,
 * the current post-type
 * and many more.
