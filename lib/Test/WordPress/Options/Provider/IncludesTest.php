 * Include an option
 *
 * To just use an option without a default value you need to add it as a simple entry:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * options:
 *   this_has_a: default value
 *   blog_public: ~
 *   admin_email: ~
 * ```
 *
 * Compared to the defaults of an option the second
 * and the third just tell the service container that those options exist.
 * It is now aware that it shall load "blog_public"
 * and "admin_email" from the options table (via `get_options`).
