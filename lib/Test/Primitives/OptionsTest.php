/**
 * Options
 *
 * WordPress-Options can be fetched using `get_options`.
 * The "options" section is needed to register specific options
 * so that they can be used in services:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * options:
 *   # Name of the option
 *   - my_own_option
 *
 * services:
 *   SomeThing:
 *     arguments: [ '%my_own_option%' ]
 * ```
 *
 *   Such basic service definition does load the option value
 * and inject it into the service.
 * This way you decouple information from the plugin/theme
 * and allow the user to configure them in the WordPress-Backend
 * (e.g. via "wp-admin/options.php").
 *
