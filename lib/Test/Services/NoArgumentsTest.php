 * Service definition
 *
 * Services can be defined using a very simple data structure:
 *
 * ```php
 * <?php
 *
 * return [
 *   Provider\Services => [
 *
 *     SomeThing::class,
 *
 *   ]
 * ];
 * ```
 *
 * This kind of definition registers one service named "SomeThing"
 * which points to an instance of same class.
 * The second is named "AnotherThing"
 * and will have the three listed arguments in the constructor.
